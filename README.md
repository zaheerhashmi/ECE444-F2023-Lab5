## Pros and Cons of TDD ##
Test driven has allowed me to ensure that the feature that I have implemented is properly working with the present code base before I proceed forward to adding more features. This has many benefits some of which include that the amount of time needed to debug the application reduced significantly. Furthermore, I ensured that the feature was successfully integrated into the application before moving forward which allowed me to focus on one feature at a time thereby increasing clarity on the requirements, and allowed me to focus on writing sufficient amounts of code to just pass the test thereby targeting my solutions and cutting down development time. This approach of development however is not without its cons some of which include an emphasis on the unit testing. Here I tested each feature individually before moving on instead of focusing on how multiple feature work together in cohesion. Another thing to consider is the false sense of security that maybe created with regards to the robustness of a particular feature. This can be the case if the unit test created is not rigorous enough to thoroughly test the feature. And finally the design limits the extent to which a given feature can be tested. Since we are testing features one at a time, features which are often grouped or bundle together from a user point of view will not be tested as effectively.
